# Power Meter SDM220-MQTT over wifi to home system.

1. MCU 1.0 /esp8266 module.
2. RS485 TTL Modbus module.
3. Logic level converter 4 channel (3.3V to 5V) Module.
4. Raspberry PI with Node-Red and MQTT broker. Visualisation nodeRed dashboard

Code is reading all available modbus information from the PowerMeter. 
****** Code is fully working *******

If somebody needs I also have Modbus/TCP-IP(port502) Version but I changed all my home devices to MQTT protocol.
